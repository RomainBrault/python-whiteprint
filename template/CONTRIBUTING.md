## How to report a problem

If you have any problem with the project check the [Q&A Discussions] maybe your
question or problem is already answered. Otherwise please open a new discussion!

## How to report an identified bug

Report identified bugs on the [Issue Tracker].

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these questions:

- Which operating system and Python version are you using?
- Which version of this project are you using?
- What did you do?
- What did you expect to see?
- What did you see instead?

The best way to get your bug fixed is to provide a test case,
and/or steps to reproduce the issue.

## How to set up your development environment

You need Python {{target_python_version}}+ and the following tools:

- [Poetry]
- [Nox] with [nox-poetry], [rich] and [beartype] additional dependencies

Once your environment is set-up, install the package with development
requirements:

```console
$ poetry install
```

You can now run an interactive Python session:

```console
$ poetry run python
```

or the command-line interface:

```console
$ poetry run {{project_slug}}
```

To avoid prefixing all your commands by `poetry run` you can source a [poetry
shell](https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/#shell) (or activate a virtual environment such as
[Mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/mamba.html),
[Conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html),
[virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) or
[venv](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)).

For example to activate a virtual environment with poetry run:

```console
$ poetry shell
```

Then you can just run an interactive Python session or the command-line interface:

```console
$ python
```

or

```console
$ whiteprint
```

## How to test the project

The test suite is managed by [nox] and [nox-poetry].

Run the full test suite:

```console
$ nox
```

List the available Nox sessions:

```console
$ nox --list-sessions
```

You can also run a specific Nox session.
For example, invoke the unit test suite like this:

```console
$ nox --session=test
```

Unit tests are located in the _tests_ directory,
and are written using the [pytest] testing framework.

## How to submit changes

Open a [pull request] to submit changes to this project.

Your pull request needs to meet the following guidelines for acceptance:

- The Nox test suite must pass without errors and warnings.
- Include unit tests. This project maintains 100% code coverage.
- If your changes add functionality, update the documentation accordingly.

Feel free to submit early, though‚Äîwe can always iterate on this.

To run linting and code formatting checks before committing your change, you
can install [pre-commit] as a Git hook by running the following command:

```console
$ nox --session=pre-commit -- install
```

It is recommended to open an issue before starting work on anything.
This will allow a chance to talk it over with the owners and validate your approach.
